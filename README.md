# My Project Euler Solutions

These were completed in 2016.

## Process for Solving

1. Write pseudo-code (if solution isn't dead-simple)
2. Write actual code
3. Test
4. Adjust code until it works
5. If it doesn't find the solution fast:
    1. Look up existing solutions
    2. Figure out the method they used to solve it
    3. Close their solution so I can't copy it directly
    4. Attempt to write my own solution using their method
